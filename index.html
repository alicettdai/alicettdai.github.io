<p> After all, “normal” is not just a stamp of approval; it can also be a dismissal, at least for anyone interested in making something new. Nelson describes a seminar she attended in graduate school with the literary theorist Jane Gallop and the art historian Rosalind Krauss. Gallop’s presentation involves a slideshow of family photos—snapshots that her husband had taken of her with their baby son. They show her naked, or in the bath, or wearing endearingly ugly shirts. She explains her current work as an attempt to discuss photography “from the standpoint of the photographed subject,” in particular, the subject “photographed as a mother.” Nelson’s into it: “I liked that Gallop was onto something and letting us in on it before she fully understood it,” Nelson writes. “She was hanging her shit out to dry.” It is, Nelson thinks, “a start.” Gallop finishes with her slides, and then Krauss—the immaculately groomed embodiment of intellectual rigor—calmly proceeds to destroy her.

“Krauss excoriated Gallop for taking her own personal situation as subject matter,” Nelson writes. “The tacit undercurrent of her argument, as I felt it, was that Gallop’s maternity had rotted her mind—besotted it with a narcissism that makes one think that an utterly ordinary experience shared by countless others is somehow unique, or uniquely interesting.”

There’s a gendered edge to Krauss’s critique (“the knee-jerk quarantining of the feminine or the maternal from the realm of intellectual profundity,” as Nelson puts it), but it is also about something more general. Normal is a hazard for artistic pursuits—the gamble of going for insight and coming up ordinary. It’s a risk that Nelson, like Gallop, is willing to court. “The Argonauts” reaches its climax with an account of giving birth to her son, Iggy; and a birth story is a bit like the female version of a war story—an endlessly repeatable, endlessly compelling ritual form. We know its contours, its rhythms, its stakes. We know that our hero makes it out alive—they’re here to testify to what they’ve seen. All that may feel familiar. But what opportunities for unexpected newness would get missed if we avoided the familiar, the conventional, the universal?

Nelson delivers her story of pregnancy and birth alongside those of Harry’s changing body and of the death of Harry’s mother. Throughout, she adopts a strategy she admires in the works of the psychologist D. W. Winnicott, whose notes on parenting pepper the text. “Winnicott is a writer for whom ordinary words are good enough,” writes Nelson. (“It is a trite remark when I say that by devoted I simply mean devoted,” Winnicott wrote.)

Such are the tools that allow Nelson to rediscover the reasons that clichés became clichés in the first place and to find the familiarity that gives them their power. It’s a feat that she’s accomplished before: “Bluets,” her beloved 2009 book-length essay, is about heartbreak. With its second-person yearning and simple central image—blue, the color, as the object of unquenchable desire—“Bluets”_ _has the force of a perfect pop song. (Give it to someone you think you might love, of any gender.) It wears its erudition lightly, Goethe and Gertrude Stein between swatches of Billie Holiday and Leonard Cohen.
